Description: 
  Network inference methods are computational tools which use
  large omics datasets to predict which genes are regulated by which 
  transcription factors. Since regulatory interactions are context-dependent,
  attempting to model regulatory dynamics in the form of a single regulatory
  network may have little relevance. This package allows to predict
  regulatory networks for individual samples, which can then be clustered
  together.
